## Conclusion

In summary, the paper presents a non-greedy method for learning decision trees, departing from traditional greedy algorithms by jointly optimizing split functions and leaf parameters at all tree levels using stochastic gradient descent. This approach offers a solution to suboptimal trees generated by greedy procedures and opens avenues for future extensions, allowing for efficiency gains through sparse split function learning and application of the kernel trick.

The proposed framework bridges decision tree learning with latent structured prediction, treating split decisions as latent variables and enabling the formulation of a piecewise, smooth upper bound on empirical loss. Experimentally, the paper demonstrates effective tree pruning during training by tuning the key hyper-parameter $v$, alongside SGD learning rate $\eta$, to construct trees balancing complexity and accuracy. Comparative analyses showed improved performance against greedy baselines, with empirical evidence showcasing the scalability of the method, particularly with fast loss-augmented inference implementation.

Overall, the paper's approach enhances decision tree induction, providing a more principled means of capturing data structure. Further research can explore extensions and optimizations within this framework, potentially advancing tree-based methods for more efficient and accurate learning.
