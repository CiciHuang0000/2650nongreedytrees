# Practical Examples 

Below we have included two realistic examples that could be seen using this algorithm in real life:

1. One example can be seen if we're trying to predict whether an email is spam or not. Our features x could be the presence of certain keywords, and y would be 'spam' or 'not spam.' By applying SGD, we iteratively refine our model's ability to classify emails accurately.

2. Another example can be seen if a bank wants to implement a machine learning model to decide whether to approve or reject loan applications. The dataset consists of various applicant features (e.g., income, credit score, employment history) and a binary outcome (loan approved/rejected).

Here is a UML diagram to describe how the algorithm works in these scenraios:
